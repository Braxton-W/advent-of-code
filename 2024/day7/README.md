### Background
Equations are to be evaluated from left to right, not by order of operations.

### Part 1 Task
Add the resulting value of each equation which can be made true by placing an addition operator (+) or multiplication operator (*) between each pair of values.

### Part 2 Task
Add the resulting value of each equation which can be made true by placing an addition operator (+), multiplication operator (*), or concatenation operator (||) between each pair of values.
