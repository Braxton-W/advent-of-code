# Day 6 Review

### Input
A 2D array representing a map for a guard, represented by '^', to traverse with obstables '#'.

Example:

```
....#.....
.........#
..........
..#.......
.......#..
..........
.#..^.....
........#.
#.........
......#...
```

### Background
The guard is to continue the path in its direction until it reaches an obstacle or exits the map.
If the guard reaches an obstacle, it is to turn 90 degrees clockwise and continue on forward.

### Part 1 Task
Count the number of distinct positions the guard visits before exiting the map.

### Part 2 Task
Count the number of different positions for a new obstacle to lead the guard into a loop.
