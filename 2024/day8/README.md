# Day 7 Review

### Input
A 2D array of alphanumeric characters joined by periods (`.`).

Example:

```
............
........0...
.....0......
.......0....
....0.......
......A.....
............
............
........A...
.........A..
............
............
```

### Background
Each alphanumeric character represents a different frequency of antenna. Antinodes are represented by a hash symbol (`#`).

### Part 1 Task
Find how many unique locations within the map exist for antinodes.
Antinodes occur when two antennas of the same frequency are in line, but only where one antenna is twice as far away from the other.

Example: 

```
..........
...#......
..........
....a.....
..........
.....a....
..........
......#...
..........
..........
```

### Part 2 Task
Find how many unique locations within the map exist for antinodes when distance from each antenna is not to be taken account for.

Example: 

```
..#.......
..........
...#......
..........
....a.....
..........
.....a....
..........
......#...
..........
.......#..
```
